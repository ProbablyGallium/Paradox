A Discord bot that does stuff, idk

*"Wait who is this nerd?"*
Hi, I'm Gallium! I hang out on Discord a lot and I made a bot.

*"A bot? Can I have it?"* [Of course you can!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=315834856095481856&scope=bot&permissions=268747841)

*"Uh...I think I broke it."* No worries, either send me a bug report with `p.report <what went wrong>` or submit an issue and I'll see what I can do.

*"Ooh, you should add--"* Send all suggestions either via `p.suggest <idea>` or a pull request, and I might add it :D
