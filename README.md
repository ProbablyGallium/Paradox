# Paradox
A Discord bot for fun, moderation, and probably maybe some other stuff I dunno

Hi, I'm Ben, or Gallium as some of you know me. I do things with programming, like [bash scripts](https://github.com/benzarr410/command-line-fun). I'm also making a [selfbot](https://github.com/benzarr410/Selfbot).

## So what's this all about?
It's a little bot I made, it's public now so you can take a looksie [here.](https://bots.discord.pw/bots/315834856095481856)
## Can I have one?
Sure! [Here you go, you need Manage Servers in a server to add it tho.](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?permissions=355392&scope=bot&client_id=315834856095481856)
## HEY, YOU COULD DO THIS BETTER!
Ok, jeez, calm down, i'm still learning. Just open up a [pull request](https://github.com/benzarr410/Paradox/pulls).
## HEY, THIS IS WRONG AND DOESN'T WORK!
Alright, open up an [issue](https://github.com/benzarr410/Paradox/issues), I'll see what I can do.
